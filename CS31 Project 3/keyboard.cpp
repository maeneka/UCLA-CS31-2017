// Given an octave number, a note letter, and an accidental sign, return
// the character that the indicated note is encoded as if it is playable.
// Return a space character if it is not playable.
//
// First parameter:   the octave number (the integer 4 is the number of the
//                    octave that starts with middle C, for example).
// Second parameter:  an upper case note letter, 'A' through 'G'
// Third parameter:   '#', 'b', or ' ' (meaning no accidental sign)
//
// Examples:  encodeNote(4, 'A', ' ') returns 'Q'
//            encodeNote(4, 'A', '#') returns '%'
//            encodeNote(4, 'H', ' ') returns ' '
